This is my discord bot from https://discord.gg/Jx4bcJvJzu

Download code and start in your computer or hosting!

You will also need the bot token to be inserted on the last line in bot_main.py file (bot.run("HERE TOKEN!")) 
After changing in the commands where there is guild_ids to the id of your discord server!
